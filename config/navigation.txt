# This doc defines the entire LHS navigation
# _except of the in-page headings navigation (which is auto-built)_
# The top-level items are titles of the tabs
# What follows is a tree of pages
# Lines *must* be indented with 2 spaces
# Each node can be
# * plain text `Some Text`
# * plain link `[/some/link]`
# * a link with custom title `Some Text[/some/link]`
# Plain text works as a link to its first child
# Plain link gets the title from the page's metainfo
# Link with custom title gets title as defines in this file
# Empty and commented lines are ignored

# Dynamic page links are identified by referencing at least 1 $dictionary
# in the link
# Dynamic page links can have title interpolation
# In this case they should also have default title when the page is not active
# (and thus it doesn't make sense to have dynamic parts in the title)
# The syntax is
# `Default title ~ Title with {{ interpolation }}[/some/$dictionary/link]`
# The axes-specific title is optional and can be omitted
